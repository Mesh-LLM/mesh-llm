# mesh-llm-sdk

Rust facade for the real embedded Mesh LLM node. `MeshNode::builder()` supports
client (`client()`), serve-only (`serve_only()`), and combined (`serve()`) roles.
The legacy thin client re-export is removed. The default feature is `serving`,
which includes the embedded runtime and native runtime management APIs.

See [Rust SDK usage](../../docs/sdk/rust.md) and
[native runtime guidance](../../docs/SDK.md#native-runtime-artifacts).

## Install the serving runtime

Client-only nodes need no native serving runtime. Before starting a serve-only
or combined node, check the cached runtime with
`native_runtime_versions_match_current_sdk`, then explicitly install a
compatible runtime when needed:

```rust,no_run
use mesh_llm_sdk::native_runtime::{
    NativeRuntimeInstallOptions, RuntimeSelection, current_runtime_release,
    current_skippy_abi_version, install_native_runtime,
    mesh_native_runtime_install_options, native_runtime_versions_match_current_sdk,
};
use mesh_llm_sdk::{MeshNode, initialize_host_runtime};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    let outcome = install_native_runtime(NativeRuntimeInstallOptions {
        release_version: current_runtime_release().to_string(),
        skippy_abi_version: Some(current_skippy_abi_version()),
        selection: RuntimeSelection::Recommended,
        ..mesh_native_runtime_install_options()
    }).await?;
    let runtime = outcome.runtime;
    anyhow::ensure!(native_runtime_versions_match_current_sdk(
        &runtime.mesh_version,
        &runtime.manifest.runtime.skippy_abi,
    ));
    runtime.load_plan()?;
    initialize_host_runtime().await?;
    let node = MeshNode::builder().serve().start().await?;
    node.shutdown().await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

The installer resolves the
recommended runtime against the current host profile and returns a compatible
cached runtime when available. The load plan verifies its libraries before
startup. Embedded node startup only loads a compatible cached
runtime; it never downloads one. Install before starting a serving node when
the cache has no matching runtime.
